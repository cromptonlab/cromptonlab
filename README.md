# Welcome to the Crompton Lab GitHub! üë©‚Äçüî¨

## About Us
The Crompton Lab is dedicated to advancing research in pediatric solid malignancies through innovative genomic and proteomic approaches. Our mission is to develop non-invasive prognostic biomarkers, novel therapeutic strategies, and enhance our understanding of tumor evolution and treatment resistance.

## Research Focus
Our research focuses on harnessing genomic and proteomic technologies to address key challenges in pediatric oncology:

- **Circulating Tumor DNA (ctDNA) Analysis:** We have pioneered methods for detecting and profiling ctDNA from "liquid biopsy" samples in pediatric cancers, enabling non-invasive monitoring of disease progression and treatment response.
- **Circulating Tumor Cells (CTCs) Investigation:** Our lab is actively developing strategies to identify, quantify, and interrogate CTCs, providing valuable insights into transcriptional and proteomic processes in cancer cells, complementing ctDNA studies.
- **Therapeutic Development for Ewing Sarcoma:** We are committed to discovering novel combinations of targeted cancer therapies for the treatment of Ewing sarcoma, a challenging bone malignancy affecting adolescents and young adults. Through high-throughput chemical screens, we aim to identify effective therapeutic strategies to improve patient outcomes.
